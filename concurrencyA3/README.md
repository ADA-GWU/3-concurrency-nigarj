# Features and purpose
Real-Time Processing: The program divides the input image into square regions and updates the display dynamically while processing it in real-time.

Single and Multithreaded Modes: Depending on their system's capabilities, users can select between single-threaded ('S') and multi-threaded ('M') processing modes to improve performance.

User Interaction: Using the console, the application asks the user to enter the processing mode, square size, and image file path.

Dynamic GUI: To provide a visual representation of the changes, the graphical user interface dynamically updates to reflect the ongoing image processing.I used Java Swing Package.

Image Resizing: The application resizes the original image to fit within a given width and height.

Saving the Output: The final image is saved as "result.jpg" in the project directory once processing is finished or closed by user.

3. Or run it manually
Open the RealProcessingTime.java code file on vscode
and there is a run command on the top right corner.
