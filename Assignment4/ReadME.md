#Features:
Real-Time Processing: The program divides the input image into square regions and updates the display dynamically while processing it in real-time.
Single and Multithreaded Modes: Depending on their system's capabilities, users can select between single-threaded ('S') and multi-threaded ('M') processing modes to improve performance.
User Interaction: Using the console, the application asks the user to enter the processing mode, square size, and image file path.
Dynamic GUI: To provide a visual representation of the changes, the graphical user interface dynamically updates to reflect the ongoing image processing.
Image Resizing: The application resizes the original image to fit within a given width and height.
Saving the Output: The final image is saved as "result.jpg" in the project directory once processing is finished.

#How to run?
Open the RealProcessingTime.java code file on vscode and there is a run command on the top right corner. Choose "Run Java" if you run it for the first time, otherwise choose "Run Code" option.

For extra information I must explain the processes in real life (face-to-face)
